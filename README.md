### About Me ‚ú®

I'm a 23 year old recent graduate from the University of Birmingham with a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, currently based in North Wales. At university, I showed an adeptness for Object Oriented Programming, and particularily enjoyed the areas where the mathematics and computing sides of my degree course overlapped, such as the application of linear regression in both linear algebra and neural computation. I am currently employed as a consultant Java test automation engineer at Sparta Global.
